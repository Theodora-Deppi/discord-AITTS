# VRChat-AI-Assistant
AI Assistant to chat with and to engage (in a limited capacity) in VRChat

Integrations with play.ht for 'realistic' voice. Currently based on a small streamer known as DetsyVR. 

# Workflow:

Microphone listens -> STT transcribe -> chatGPT -> play.ht TTS response -> loop

## Still in development. bot_openai.py is able to create everything required, however only listens to local microphone. 
## Currently in progress: Discord bot integration, to allow colaboration over Discord voice chat.
